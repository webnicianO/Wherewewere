# Wherewewere
A one-time time-capsule of information stored into the blockchain that can only be created by participants during the event (2-5 hrs) via smart contract.

(no accounts or anything for the proof-of-concept), one can make an event or see other events on it. When an event is made, a corresponding smart contract will be made with the title and description and a QR code will be given to the host. When the event time starts, people who follow the correct URL at the right time can post to the site which the posts a TX with the message from the site address to the event address. The event address will only accept input from the sitewide site address.
